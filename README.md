### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student with experience from 2 internships at Microsoft (1 Explore, 1 Software engineering).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a leetcode chrome extension I call: CODEBLOCK!!! There is also my YouTube channel where I post tutorials and tech-related videos (Mr.Beast is my favorite YouTuber! Maybe one day I can reach his level.)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML and AI. Buzzwords aside, I am really interested in the engineering behind deploying models in production to solve problems in real life. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at jackhe2345@gmail.com! I'd love to chat.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can deadlift at most 800 lbs, at least 135 lbs, squat at most 800, at least 135 lbs, bench at most 405 lbs, at least 90 lbs.
