### Hi there, I am Jack! ðŸ‘‹

I graduated UBC with a degree in Computer Science in 4 years :)

As an undergrad, I did 4 internships, 3 at Microsoft and 1 at Nuro.

Now, I am a full time software engineer at Microsoft working on Operating Systems networking in C and C++ (GOTTA GO FAST!).

Happy to chat about these experiences, reach me at jackhe2345@gmail.com
